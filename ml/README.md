# ML - Gesture Recognition

This folder contains Python code and notebooks for gesture data collection and model training.

## Overview

We'll record pose landmarks with MediaPipe, label gestures (NEXT, PREV, SELECT, etc.), and train a gesture classifier.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Structure

- `data/` - Raw and processed gesture data
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
- `scripts/` - Python scripts for data collection and training
- `models/` - Trained gesture classification models
