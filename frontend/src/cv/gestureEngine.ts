 * @param landmarks - Array of pose landmarks from MediaPipe Pose
 * @param sensitivityFactor - Optional factor to adjust thresholds (defaults to value from localStorage).
 *                            If not provided, reads from localStorage["gestureSensitivity"] (default 0.12).
 *                            Lower values = easier to trigger, Higher values = harder to trigger.
 * @returns The detected gesture type, or "REST" if no gesture is detected or landmarks are invalid
 *
 * Rules (using ML-derived thresholds):
 * - NEXT: Left wrist is significantly to the left of left shoulder (dxLeft > threshold)
 *         and roughly at the same vertical level as the shoulder (absDyLeft < tolerance)
 *         Uses NEXT_DX_LEFT_MIN and NEXT_ABS_DY_LEFT_MAX thresholds from ML analysis.
 *
 * - PREV: Right wrist is significantly to the right of right shoulder (dxRight > threshold)
 *         and roughly at the same vertical level as the shoulder (absDyRight < tolerance)
 *         Uses PREV_DX_RIGHT_MIN and PREV_ABS_DY_RIGHT_MAX thresholds from ML analysis.

 *           (dy < threshold, where more negative dy = wrist higher than shoulder)
 *           In our coordinate system (y decreases upward), more negative dy values indicate wrist above shoulder.
